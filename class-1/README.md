# 📌 Prompt vs. Context

This README explains the clear difference between **Prompt** and **Context** when working with AI models.

## 🧠 What is a Prompt? (📤 Direct Instruction)
A **prompt** is the **direct instruction** you give to an AI model. It tells the AI **exactly what task** you want it to perform.

### ✔️ Examples:
- "Write a poem about friendship."
- "Summarize this paragraph."
- "Create a marketing plan for an online clothing brand."

## 📘 What is Context? (📚 Background Information)
**Context** is the **background information** that helps the AI understand the purpose, situation, or details surrounding the prompt. It improves accuracy and relevance.

### ✔️ Examples:
- Providing dataset details before asking for analysis.
- Sharing your business niche before requesting a marketing plan.
- Adding previous conversation history for continuity.

## 🔍 Key Differences (With Emojis)

```

--------|---------|
| Direct command or question | Supporting information |
| Tells AI what to do | Helps AI do it better |
| Short and specific | Broader and descriptive |

## 💡 Why Both Matter?
Using only prompts gives generic results.
Using prompts **with context** gives **accurate, personalized, and high‑quality output**.

## 🧩 Example (Visual Comparison)
**Prompt:** "Write a workout plan."

**Context:** "I am a beginner, want to lose fat, have knee pain, and can exercise only 20 minutes daily."

➡️ **With context, AI gives a fully personalized and accurate plan.**

If you want, I can also add **illustrations, emojis, formatting styles**, or **turn this into a professional LinkedIn post**.
