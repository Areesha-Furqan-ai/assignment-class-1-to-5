# 🧠 Tree of Thought (ToT) vs Chain of Thought (CoT)

This README clearly explains the difference between **Tree of Thought reasoning** and **Chain of Thought reasoning** used in AI.

---

## 🔗 Chain of Thought (CoT)
**CoT** is a *linear reasoning process*. AI thinks step-by-step in a straight line.

### ✔️ Key Points:
- Simple, straight reasoning path
- No branching or multiple possibilities
- Faster but less creative
- Good for math problems, instructions, simple logic

### 📘 Example:
```
Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 → Final Answer
```

---

## 🌳 Tree of Thought (ToT)
**ToT** is a *branching reasoning process*. AI explores multiple possible paths, compares them, and chooses the best one.

### ✔️ Key Points:
- Multiple branches of reasoning
- More creative + exhaustive thinking
- Slower but high-quality results
- Good for planning, writing, decision-making

### 📘 Example:
```
          ┌→ Path A → Result A
Start  →──┤
          └→ Path B → Result B (chosen)
```

| 🧩 Feature | 🔗 CoT | 🌳 ToT |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Reasoning style | Linear | Branching |
| Creativity | Low | High |
| Speed | Fast | Slower |
| Best for | Simple tasks | Complex reasoning |
| Approach | One path | Multiple paths |

## 🧩 Summary
- **CoT = Straight line reasoning**
- **ToT = Branching tree reasoning**
- ToT is better for *exploration*, CoT is better for *speed*
